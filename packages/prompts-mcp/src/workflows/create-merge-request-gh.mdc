# Create Merge Request Workflow for GitHub

This document outlines the automated workflow for creating a GitHub merge request using the `gh` command-line tool.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Prerequisite: Check for `gh`
- **Trigger**: The merge request creation process is initiated.
- **Action**:
    - Verify that the `gh` command-line tool is installed and available in the system's PATH.
    - Execute the following shell command:
      ```shell
      command -v gh
      ```
- **Success**: The command returns a path to the `gh` executable and exits with a status code of 0. The workflow proceeds to the next step.
- **Error Handling**: If the command fails (returns a non-zero exit code), the workflow is aborted. The user is notified with the following message: "Error: `gh` command not found. Please install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to proceed. You can find installation instructions at: https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/getting-started-with-github-cli"

### 2. Check Authentication Status
- **Trigger**: `gh` is confirmed to be installed.
- **Action**:
    - Execute the following shell command to check authentication status:
      ```shell
      gh auth status
      ```
- **Success**: The command returns authentication information and exits with status code 0.
- **Error Handling**: If authentication fails, prompt the user to run `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub.

### 3. Validate Current Repository
- **Trigger**: Authentication is confirmed.
- **Action**:
    - Execute the following shell command to check if the current directory is a Git repository:
      ```shell
      gh repo view
      ```
- **Success**: The command returns repository information and exits with status code 0.
- **Error Handling**: If the command fails, notify the user that they must be in a Git repository directory.

### 4. Check Current Branch Status
- **Trigger**: Repository validation is successful.
- **Action**:
    - Execute the following shell commands to check current branch and status:
      ```shell
      git branch --show-current
      git status --porcelain
      ```
- **Output**: Current branch name and any uncommitted changes.
- **Error Handling**: If there are uncommitted changes, prompt the user to commit or stash them before proceeding.

### 5. Collect Merge Request Information
- **Trigger**: Branch status is confirmed to be clean.
- **Action**: Collect the following information from the user:
    - **Title**: A concise, descriptive title for the merge request
    - **Description**: Detailed description of the changes (optional but recommended)
    - **Base Branch**: The target branch for the merge (default: main/master)
    - **Labels**: Any labels to apply to the merge request (optional)
    - **Assignees**: GitHub usernames to assign to the merge request (optional)
    - **Reviewers**: GitHub usernames to request reviews from (optional)

### 6. Create the Merge Request
- **Trigger**: All required information has been collected.
- **Action**:
    - Execute the following shell command to create the merge request:
      ```shell
      gh pr create --title "$title" --body "$description" --base "$base_branch"
      ```
    - If labels are specified:
      ```shell
      gh pr create --title "$title" --body "$description" --base "$base_branch" --label "$labels"
      ```
    - If assignees are specified:
      ```shell
      gh pr create --title "$title" --body "$description" --base "$base_branch" --assignee "$assignees"
      ```
    - If reviewers are specified:
      ```shell
      gh pr create --title "$title" --body "$description" --base "$base_branch" --reviewer "$reviewers"
      ```
- **Output**: The URL of the newly created merge request.
- **Error Handling**: If the command fails, provide specific error messages and suggestions for resolution.

### 7. Post-Creation Actions
- **Trigger**: Merge request is successfully created.
- **Action**:
    - Display the merge request URL to the user
    - Optionally open the merge request in the default browser:
      ```shell
      gh pr view --web
      ```
    - Provide next steps and recommendations:
        - Review the merge request description
        - Add any additional context or screenshots
        - Request reviews from team members
        - Set up any required CI/CD checks

### 8. Summary and Confirmation
- **Trigger**: All post-creation actions are complete.
- **Action**:
    - Generate a summary of the created merge request including:
        1. **Merge Request URL**: Direct link to the created PR
        2. **Title**: The title of the merge request
        3. **Base Branch**: The target branch
        4. **Current Branch**: The source branch
        5. **Status**: Current status (draft, ready for review, etc.)
        6. **Next Steps**: Recommended actions for the user
- **Output**: A comprehensive summary presented to the user in the chat interface.

## Error Handling Guidelines

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Prompt user to run `gh auth login`
   - Provide link to GitHub CLI documentation

2. **Repository Issues**:
   - Ensure user is in a Git repository
   - Check if the repository is connected to GitHub

3. **Branch Issues**:
   - Verify current branch exists on remote
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Ensure branch is up to date with base branch

4. **Permission Issues**:
   - Verify user has write access to the repository
   - Check if user can create merge requests

5. **Network Issues**:
